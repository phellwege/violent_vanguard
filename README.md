### What I learned

This was fairly straight forwards; I worked with the client directly, and produced a website meeting their needs. I integrated several libraries that really made this project come together nicely. Improved performance with the use of website design fundamentals such as lazy loading and correct img sizes.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has always been one of my go to's for any project that I have a minor question on.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Stack overflow is an amazing resource where most of the questions that you could possibly have, have already been answered.
